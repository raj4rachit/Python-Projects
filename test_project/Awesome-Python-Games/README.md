Learn Python by developing fun to play games like Pong and Asteroids. The games range from basic ones (which demonstrate basic concepts in Python) to some advanced ones which demonstrate the concepts of Classes in Python along with the Physics logic required to make such games. 

These games were made as assignments during the course "[Interactive Programming in Python by Rice University - Part 1 & 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1)." I am sharing these for learning purposes since it always feels awesome to make a game using any programming language :)

There are total 8 games which are intuitively in increasing order of complexity hence making the last one named 'Asteroids' a really cool game to look at.

## 1- Rock-Paper-Scissors

## 2- Guess the Number

## 7- Spaceship

## 8- Asteroids

## How to Run
The games run on the browser-based programming environment [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/). Simply copy all of a game's code and paste it in the CodeSkulptor Editor. Then just click the Run button and the game will get started.

## Note
These games are built in Python 2. They use a specific library to draw the canvas and to do the event-based programming. This library named 'simplegui' is only accessible in the browser based IDE CodeSkulptor hence its necessary to run the code using CodeSkulptor.
